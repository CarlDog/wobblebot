# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This file tracks major system decisions.

## ADR-001 — Use Hexagonal Architecture
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Need for modularity & testability
**Decision:** Use Ports/Adapters pattern across all modules
**Consequences:** Clean module isolation, easier long-term extensibility

## ADR-002 — LLM Is Advisory-Only
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** LLM cannot generate executable commands
**Reason:** Safety and determinism

## ADR-003 — Separate Withdrawals into Harvester Module
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Need to keep Kraken trading key safe
**Decision:** Only Harvester key may initiate transfers
**Consequence:** Strong compartmentalization of financial power

## ADR-004 — Use Kraken API for Fund Transfers (No Separate Banking Integration)
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** November 24, 2025
**Context:** Initial assumption was that Harvester would need to integrate with separate bank APIs (ACH, wire transfer systems) in addition to Kraken. Upon creating a live Kraken account with $100 deposit, discovered that Kraken's API provides withdrawal endpoints that handle bank transfers directly.
**Decision:** Harvester will use Kraken's withdrawal API for all fund transfers (exchange → bank). No separate BankingPort or banking adapter is needed.
**Alternatives Considered:**
- Build separate banking API integration (rejected: unnecessary complexity, YAGNI)
- Abstract BankingPort for future flexibility (rejected: premature abstraction for Phase 1-5)
**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Simpler architecture, single integration point, less code, easier testing
- **Positive:** Phase 4 implementation is significantly simpler
- **Positive:** Single API key strategy works (Harvester key has withdrawal permissions)
- **Negative:** Tightly coupled to Kraken (acceptable for Phase 1-5, can abstract later if multi-exchange needed)
**Implementation:** Harvester depends only on ExchangePort (with withdrawal-enabled Kraken adapter) and StoragePort

## ADR-005 — Align Domain Models with Kraken API Data Structures
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** November 24, 2025
**Context:** Phase 1.2 domain model design required decisions on entity IDs (UUID vs string), order status vocabulary, timestamp formats, and field naming conventions. Research into Kraken REST API v0 revealed specific data structure patterns that affect adapter implementation complexity.

**Decision:** Adopt Kraken-aligned data structures in domain models with strategic abstractions:

1. **Dual ID Strategy:**
   - Internal `id: UUID` for database primary keys
   - External `exchange_id: str | None` for Kraken transaction IDs (txid format)

2. **Order Status Values:**
   - Use Kraken's canonical: `"pending"`, `"open"`, `"closed"`, `"canceled"`, `"expired"`
   - Replace `"filled"` → `"closed"` (Kraken's term)
   - Replace `"cancelled"` → `"canceled"` (American spelling matches Kraken)
   - Remove `"failed"` (Kraken doesn't use this; submission failures don't create order records)

3. **Trade Model:**
   - `id: str` (Kraken trade txid, not UUID)
   - `order_id: str` (Kraken parent order txid)
   - `fee: Decimal` (simplified from `Amount` — fee currency is always quote)
   - Add `cost: Decimal` field (Kraken provides this as price × volume)

4. **Timestamp Extensions:**
   - Add `Timestamp.to_unix_seconds()` method for Kraken API format (float seconds)

5. **Position Model:**
   - Defer to Phase 3+ (margin-specific, not needed for spot trading)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Pure domain-driven design with custom vocabulary (rejected: adapter complexity)
- Abstract exchange interface with factory pattern (rejected: premature for single exchange)

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Minimal adapter mapping code, direct API compatibility
- **Positive:** String IDs are industry-standard for crypto exchanges
- **Positive:** Dual ID strategy preserves multi-exchange flexibility
- **Positive:** Clearer semantics (`"closed"` is self-explanatory)
- **Negative:** Domain models favor Kraken conventions (acceptable trade-off for Phase 1-4)
- **Negative:** Breaking change for existing tests (not yet merged, safe to update)

**Compliance:** Aligns with ADR-001 (hexagonal architecture), ADR-003 (safety constraints), and Constraint C-003 (no adapter dependencies in domain).

## ADR-006 — Grid Engine Architecture
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-05-14
**Context:** Stage 2.2 introduces the first money-touching engine code: a configurable per-coin grid that places limit orders above and below a reference price and rotates buy/sell pairs into realized cycles. Stage 2.2 wires the engine to `MockExchangeAdapter` (paper); Stage 2.3 swaps in `KrakenAdapter` (real money, tiny size). The engine code is identical between the two — the adapter swap is the only delta. Several design choices recur in grid-bot literature with different tradeoffs; pinning them here prevents mid-slice relitigation. Full design discussion: [stage-2.2-design.md](../planning/stage-2.2-design.md).

**Decision:** Adopt the following six policies for the Stage 2.2 grid engine. Keep them stable across Stages 2.2-2.4; revisit only via a follow-on ADR.

1. **Grid re-centering policy: stay parked.**
   If price exits the configured grid window (above the highest sell or below the lowest buy), the engine does not re-center. The grid sits where it was placed and waits for price to return. Emit an "offside" log signal so the operator can intervene; consider an automatic per-coin pause after N ticks offside (deferred to slice 2.2.4).
   *Rejected:* automatic re-centering. The grid is a mean-reversion bet; chasing trend defeats the strategy and converts a controlled losing scenario (idle while offside) into an uncontrolled one (filling fresh buys at the top of a downtrend).

2. **Partial fill handling: leave the remainder open; counter the filled portion.**
   When a grid order partially fills, the unfilled remainder stays as-is on the exchange. The engine places a counter-order sized to the *filled* portion at the next grid level.
   *Rejected:* cancel-and-replace. Introduces a race window (the remainder may fill between cancel and replace), burns extra fees, and works against Kraken's native partial-fill accounting which already does the right thing.

3. **Source of truth for open orders: DB primary, exchange ultimate.**
   The engine reads `GridSlot` state from SQLite each tick and acts on that snapshot. At startup and every N ticks (default N=100, configurable), it reconciles against `ExchangePort.get_open_orders` — orders that exist on the exchange but not in our DB are imported; orders in our DB that no longer exist on the exchange are marked closed and trigger counter-action logic.
   *Reason:* restart resilience requires durable state, and the engine can crash between "send AddOrder" and "persist response." Reconciliation is the only convergent strategy under outages, region failovers, or process restarts.

4. **Order ID strategy: `GridSlot` is a derived view; only `GridState` (the anchor) is persisted.**
   `domain/grid.py` defines:
   ```python
   class GridSlot(BaseModel):
       symbol: Symbol
       side: OrderSide
       level_price: Decimal
       order_id: UUID | None  # None = empty slot, awaiting placement
   ```
   The grid is a *layout*; orders are *transient occupants* of slots. Separating the two lets `step()` reason about "what should exist" without coupling to "what currently exists."

   The only persisted entity is `GridState` (one row per symbol: `reference_price`, `spacing_percentage`, `levels_above`, `levels_below`, `created_at`). Each tick the engine reconstitutes `GridSlot`s by:
   1. `compute_grid_levels(grid_state)` to get the layout, then
   2. querying the existing `orders` table for open orders matching each level's price, to fill in `order_id`.

   *Rejected:* a separate `grid_slot` table with FKs to `orders.id`. Two tables would create FK consistency burden, a second source of truth for "is this slot occupied," and a place where the engine's view could disagree with the order table. Deriving slots from one table eliminates that class of bug, and the `Order` table is already authoritative for order state per ADR-005.

5. **Concurrency model: single asyncio task, per-coin `asyncio.Lock`.**
   For Stage 2.2 a single task steps each coin in turn. Each `Symbol` carries an `asyncio.Lock` so `step()` is re-entrant-safe if Stage 5 hardening later parallelizes per-coin tasks.
   *Rejected:* per-coin parallel tasks now. Adds real-time-ordering bugs that are hard to test deterministically and is unnecessary at the planned 5-second tick rate.

6. **Operational defaults (from the design doc's open questions).**
   - **Tick rate: 5 seconds.** Frequent enough to react to micro-grid moves, well below Kraken's rate limit. Revisit at Stage 2.3 against the live rate-limit budget.
   - **Order TTL: none.** Grid orders sit on the exchange until they fill, are canceled by the operator, or are pruned by reconciliation. Standard grid-bot practice — TTLs trade controlled idle for uncontrolled re-placement churn.
   - **Cycle reporting: log + persist per cycle, no batching.** A "cycle" (matched buy + sell at adjacent levels) is rare enough at micro scale that per-cycle logs are not noisy. Batching would obscure the operator's view of recent activity.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Trailing-stop or moving grid.** Folded into decision 1 (rejected). Mean-reversion strategies cannot also be trend-following without becoming a third, worse thing.
- **In-memory-only state with Kraken as truth.** Folded into decision 3 (rejected). Crashes mid-placement leave orphaned exchange state with no engine record.
- **One asyncio.Task per coin from day one.** Folded into decision 5 (rejected for now). Defer to Phase 5 if profiling shows master-task throughput is the bottleneck.

**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Engine code is fully deterministic for a fixed price walk + initial state, making slice 2.2.5's integration test feasible.
- **Positive:** Stage 2.2 → Stage 2.3 transition is a one-line adapter swap in the wiring layer; the engine itself does not change.
- **Positive:** `GridSlot` separation makes "what cycles have completed" a derived query against `Order`/`Trade` tables — no parallel state machine.
- **Negative:** Stay-parked policy will produce extended idle stretches in trending markets. Acceptable — the operator chose a mean-reversion strategy.
- **Negative:** Reconciliation cadence (N=100) is a tuning knob with no theoretically optimal value. Acceptable — start at 100, surface the metric, adjust based on observed drift.

**Compliance:** Aligns with ADR-001 (hexagonal — engine depends only on `ExchangePort` + `StoragePort`), ADR-005 (Kraken-aligned domain models — `GridSlot.order_id` references the same `Order.id: UUID` already in use). No conflict with ADR-002/003/004; this ADR predates LLM advisory and Harvester involvement and does not constrain them.
