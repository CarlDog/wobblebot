# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

This file tracks major system decisions.

## ADR-001 — Use Hexagonal Architecture
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Need for modularity & testability
**Decision:** Use Ports/Adapters pattern across all modules
**Consequences:** Clean module isolation, easier long-term extensibility

## ADR-002 — LLM Is Advisory-Only
**Status:** Accepted
**Decision:** LLM cannot generate executable commands
**Reason:** Safety and determinism

## ADR-003 — Separate Withdrawals into Harvester Module
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Need to keep Kraken trading key safe
**Decision:** Only Harvester key may initiate transfers
**Consequence:** Strong compartmentalization of financial power

## ADR-004 — Use Kraken API for Fund Transfers (No Separate Banking Integration)
**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** November 24, 2025
**Context:** Initial assumption was that Harvester would need to integrate with separate bank APIs (ACH, wire transfer systems) in addition to Kraken. Upon creating a live Kraken account with $100 deposit, discovered that Kraken's API provides withdrawal endpoints that handle bank transfers directly.
**Decision:** Harvester will use Kraken's withdrawal API for all fund transfers (exchange → bank). No separate BankingPort or banking adapter is needed.
**Alternatives Considered:**
- Build separate banking API integration (rejected: unnecessary complexity, YAGNI)
- Abstract BankingPort for future flexibility (rejected: premature abstraction for Phase 1-5)
**Consequences:**
- **Positive:** Simpler architecture, single integration point, less code, easier testing
- **Positive:** Phase 4 implementation is significantly simpler
- **Positive:** Single API key strategy works (Harvester key has withdrawal permissions)
- **Negative:** Tightly coupled to Kraken (acceptable for Phase 1-5, can abstract later if multi-exchange needed)
**Implementation:** Harvester depends only on ExchangePort (with withdrawal-enabled Kraken adapter) and StoragePort
